# IAC-10 Water Level Controller (Hardware Project)

Hardware-based automatic water level controller with pump control, tank level sensing, and visual status indicators. Supports both single-phase and three-phase pump systems.

---

## 📌 Overview

The IAC-10 Water Level Controller is a hardware-designed automatic pump control system developed in 2020 to regulate water levels in storage tanks and reservoirs.

The system automatically activates the pump when the water level falls below a defined threshold and stops the pump once the tank reaches full capacity. This prevents overflow, reduces dry-tank conditions, and extends pump lifespan through controlled operation cycles.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Eliminate manual pump switching
- Prevent water overflow
- Improve pump longevity
- Provide clear operational status feedback
- Deliver reliable long-term performance

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Automatic water level control
- Manual / Auto / Off operation modes
- LED status indicator system
- Quick response switching
- Durable panel enclosure
- Compatible with single and three-phase pumps

---

## 🔧 System Operation

A tank-mounted water level sensor detects water level changes and sends signals to the control panel.

### When Water Level is Low:
- Pump activates automatically
- Yellow indicator turns ON

### When Tank is Full:
- Pump stops automatically
- Blue indicator turns ON

### System Power Status:
- Green indicator shows system is powered and active
